# yelp-analysis
This is a project done to analyse the YELP DATASET using its ER diagram.

Using a dataset from a US-based organization called Yelp provides a platform for users to review and rate their interactions with various organizations â€“ businesses, restaurants, health clubs, hospitals, local governmental offices, charitable organizations, etc. Yelp has made a portion of this data available for personal, educational, and academic purposes.

In this analysis, I answer a few questions.
Also, I analysed 2 problems 
            1) Study the preference among different types of food on yelp.
            2) Predicting the number of fans a user will have
